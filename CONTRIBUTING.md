# Contributing to KwaaiNet
## Building Distributed AI Infrastructure Together

Welcome to the KwaaiNet community! We're building open-source distributed AI infrastructure where users own their compute and data. This guide will help you contribute effectively to this mission.

## Development Philosophy

### "Open Architecture, Community Built"
- **Transparent Architecture**: Open technical specifications and decision-making
- **Community Implementation**: Collaborative development across all components
- **Quality Gates**: Rigorous review and integration processes ensure production readiness

### Mission-Driven Development
We're not just building software - we're democratizing AI infrastructure for humanity:
- **Long-term Vision**: Belief in distributed AI's transformative potential
- **Community Ownership**: Open-source governance and collective stewardship
- **Open Source**: MIT license ensures maximum accessibility and adoption

## How to Contribute

### 🛠 Ways to Contribute

1. **Core Development**: Work on major components (see ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. **Documentation Improvements**: Enhance guides, fix typos, add examples
3. **Bug Reports**: Submit detailed issue reports with reproduction steps
4. **Feature Development**: Propose and implement new features aligned with distributed AI vision
5. **Testing**: Help test components across different platforms and scenarios
6. **Integration Examples**: Create integration examples for storage/identity systems
7. **Community Support**: Help other contributors and users

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Rust**: Latest stable version (https://rustup.rs/)
- **Node.js**: Version 18+ for web components
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration

### Local Development Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet.git
cd KwaaiNet

# Set up Rust toolchain
rustup update stable

# Build the CLI
cd core && cargo build --release -p kwaainet

# Run tests
cargo test

# Build documentation
cargo doc --open
```

### Cleaning up

Build artifacts accumulate quickly (`core/target/` can reach 20 GB+). Use the cleanup script to reset to a clean state:

```bash
./scripts/clean.sh              # interactive — confirm each step
./scripts/clean.sh --all        # remove everything without prompting
./scripts/clean.sh --dry-run    # preview what would be removed
```

The script removes:
- `core/target/` — Rust build artifacts
- `/tmp/go-libp2p-daemon-*` — stale Go clone dirs from the p2pd build hook
- `/usr/local/bin/kwaainet` + `p2pd` — manually copied binaries
- `~/.cargo/bin/kwaainet` — cargo-installed binary

### Development Workflow
1. **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account
2. **Create** a feature branch from `main`
3. **Develop** your contribution with tests and documentation
4. **Test** thoroughly across target platforms
5. **Submit** pull request with detailed description
6. **Iterate** based on code review feedback

## Code Standards

### Rust Code Guidelines
```rust
// Use clear, descriptive names
pub struct SovereignAINode {
    inference_engine: CandelEngine,
    network_layer: P2PNetwork,
}

// Document all public APIs
/// Initialize a new sovereign AI node with the given configuration
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `config` - Node configuration including network peers and resource limits
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `Result<SovereignAINode>` - Initialized node or configuration error
pub async fn initialize(config: NodeConfig) -> Result<Self> {
    // Implementation
}

// Use Result types for error handling
pub type KwaaiResult<T> = Result<T, KwaaiError>;

// Implement comprehensive error types
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum KwaaiError {
    #[error("Network connection failed: {0}")]
    NetworkError(String),
    #[error("Model loading failed: {0}")]
    ModelError(String),
}
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Guidelines
```javascript
// Use TypeScript for type safety
interface KwaaiNetConfig {
    services: ServiceConfiguration;
    privacy: PrivacySettings;
    economics: EconomicSettings;
}

// Follow modern async/await patterns
class KwaaiNet {
    async initialize(config: KwaaiNetConfig): Promise<void> {
        // Implementation with proper error handling
    }
    
    on(event: string, callback: EventCallback): void {
        // Event-driven architecture
    }
}

// Use JSDoc for documentation
/**
 * Initialize KwaaiNet with sovereign AI services
 * @param {KwaaiNetConfig} config - Configuration object
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when initialization complete
 */
```

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component functionality
- **Platform Tests**: Verify functionality across target platforms
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark against specified requirements

### Documentation Standards
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all public APIs
- **Examples**: Working code examples for common use cases
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for complex integrations
- **Architecture Docs**: High-level system design and component interactions

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Requirements
1. **Clear Description**: Explain what the PR does and why
2. **Test Coverage**: Include tests for new functionality
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Performance**: Ensure no performance regressions

## Release Process

Only maintainers cut releases. Releases are fully automated via [cargo-dist](https://opensource.axodotdev.com/cargo-dist/) — pushing a version tag triggers the CI workflow which builds all platforms, generates installers, verifies checksums, and publishes the Homebrew formula.

### 1. Bump the version number

The canonical version lives in two places in `core/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
version = "X.Y.Z"          # ← bump here

[workspace.package]
version = "X.Y.Z"          # ← and here
```

All crates use `version.workspace = true` and are updated automatically. Refresh the lockfile:

```bash
cd core && cargo update -p kwaainet
```

### 2. Commit, tag, and push

```bash
git add core/Cargo.toml core/Cargo.lock
git commit -m "chore: bump version to vX.Y.Z"
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:
- Builds `kwaainet` for all 5 targets (macOS ARM/Intel, Linux x86_64/ARM64, Windows x86_64)
- Builds `p2pd` (Go) for each platform via `scripts/build-p2pd.sh`
- Generates SHA256-verified `.tar.xz` / `.zip` archives
- Publishes `kwaainet-installer.sh` and `kwaainet-installer.ps1`
- Pushes the Homebrew formula to `Kwaai-AI-Lab/homebrew-tap`

### 3. Verify the release

- **Actions tab**: all 5 `build-local-artifacts` jobs + `build-global-artifacts` + `publish-homebrew-formula` green
- **Release page**: `.tar.xz` for each platform, `.zip` for Windows, `kwaainet-installer.sh/ps1`, `sha256.sum`
- **Installer test**: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf .../kwaainet-installer.sh | sh` → correct version
- **Homebrew test**: `brew upgrade kwaainet && kwaainet --version`
