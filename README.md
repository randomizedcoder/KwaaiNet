# KwaaiNet

[![KwaaiNet — Sovereign AI Infrastructure](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ES9iQWkAFeY/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ES9iQWkAFeY)

KwaaiNet is a decentralized AI node architecture for **Layer 8** — the trust and intelligence layer above the traditional network stack — built by the [Kwaai Foundation](https://www.kwaai.ai), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit AI lab focused on democratizing AI.

Each KwaaiNet node combines:

- A **decentralized trust graph** (cryptographic identity, verifiable credentials, local trust scores).
- **Shared, sharded LLM compute** over heterogeneous CPUs/GPUs using Petals-style distributed inference.
- **Secure multi-tenant knowledge storage** via Virtual Private Knowledge (VPK) with encrypted vector search.
- **Intent-based, peer-to-peer networking** that routes based on "what I need" (model, trust tier, latency), not just IP addresses.

From an app's point of view, KwaaiNet looks like a familiar chat-completion style HTTP API. Under the hood, it is a person-anchored Layer 8 fabric where every node is tied to an accountable human or organization.

## Why KwaaiNet?

Today's "Layer 8" — the AI and agent layer that mediates how people see information and act in the world — is mostly provided by closed platforms you rent and cannot inspect.

KwaaiNet offers an alternative:

- **Owners, not renters** — Run intelligent agents on infrastructure you and your community own and govern, instead of renting access to proprietary stacks.
- **Trust-first, not anonymous compute** — Every node carries an Ed25519-anchored identity, W3C Verifiable Credentials, and a local, time-decayed trust score; there is no central trust registry.
- **Knowledge as a first-class, private citizen** — VPK lets you shard encrypted knowledge across nodes and query it without exposing raw content.
- **Intent-based networking** — Nodes route requests based on intents like "model X, minimum trust tier Verified, max latency Y," making the network semantic and economic, not just transport. See [docs/network-and-intent-routing.md](docs/network-and-intent-routing.md) for the full intent lifecycle.

## Project status: where we are now

KwaaiNet is under active development. The Rust CLI and node implementation already ship many core capabilities; others are in progress or still research.

Today, a KwaaiNet node can:

- Run as a native Rust binary (`kwaainet`) with pre-built cross-platform releases.
- Generate a persistent Ed25519 keypair at `~/.kwaainet/identity.key` and derive a stable `PeerId` / `did:peer:` DID.
- Maintain a local W3C Verifiable Credential wallet under `~/.kwaainet/credentials/` with credential types like `FiduciaryPledgeVC`, `VerifiedNodeVC`, `UptimeVC`, `ThroughputVC`, `EventAttendeeVC`, and `PeerEndorsementVC`.
- Compute a local, time-decayed trust score for peers, grouped into tiers (`Unknown`, `Known`, `Verified`, `Trusted`).
- Join a libp2p + Kademlia DHT swarm compatible with Petals/Hivemind for node discovery and health checks.
- Serve and consume **block-sharded LLM inference** (CandelEngine): SafeTensors loading, RoPE, GQA, SwiGLU, per-session KV-cache, and temperature/top-k/top-p sampling, exposed through an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API.
- Auto-detect local models and network state to smart-select what to serve, and appear on the public map when properly configured at [map.kwaai.ai](https://map.kwaai.ai).

See the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet/releases/latest) for the most recent feature list and release notes.

## Quickstart: run a node and make a request

This quickstart shows how to install the native Rust CLI, start a node, and send a simple chat-completion request against its OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

> **Note:** Exact flags and defaults may evolve. Check `kwaainet --help` for current options.

### 1. Install the `kwaainet` CLI

**Shell installer (macOS / Linux):**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet/releases/latest/download/kwaainet-installer.sh | sh
```

**PowerShell installer (Windows):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet/releases/latest/download/kwaainet-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

**Homebrew (macOS / Linux — optional):**

```bash
brew install kwaai-ai-lab/tap/kwaainet
```

**cargo binstall (downloads prebuilt binary):**

```bash
cargo binstall kwaainet
```

**Build from source:**

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet kwaainet
```

Then confirm:

```bash
kwaainet --help
```

### 2. Initialize and start a node

Initialize node identity and config:

```bash
kwaainet setup
```

This generates `~/.kwaainet/identity.key` (Ed25519 keypair) and creates a default config with a smart default node name (e.g. `alice-linux-aarch64`).

> If `kwaainet start` reports that `p2pd` is missing (e.g. manual install from a `.tar.xz`), run `kwaainet setup --get-deps` to download and install it automatically.

Start the node:

```bash
kwaainet start --daemon
```

The node will:

- Connect to bootstrap peers and announce itself on the DHT.
- Load or download model shards (depending on your configuration).
- Expose an HTTP API compatible with the OpenAI chat-completion interface.

### 3. Call the OpenAI-compatible API

```bash
curl http://localhost:11435/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "your-model-id",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, KwaaiNet!"}
    ]
  }'
```

This sends a chat-completion request to your local node, which may route it through a shard chain of other nodes depending on configuration and trust requirements.

For a full walkthrough including platform specifics, model discovery, and Python/JS examples see **[docs/getting-started-node.md](docs/getting-started-node.md)** and **[docs/api-quickstart.md](docs/api-quickstart.md)**.

## Roadmap: destination vs current implementation

KwaaiNet's roadmap is defined as the **gap** between the aspirational Layer 8 architecture in the whitepapers and the currently shipping Rust implementation.

| Area    | Aspirational (whitepapers)                                                                 | Current implementation (Rust node)                                       |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trust   | 5-layer trust pipeline including Testable Credentials (PVP-1) and EigenTrust propagation. | Identity + VC wallet + local time-decayed trust scores shipped; ToIP work in progress. |
| Compute | Sharded inference, decentralized training, safe tool-calling with trust-gated policies.   | Petals-style block-sharded inference and OpenAI-compatible API shipped. |
| Storage | Fully distributed personal AI memory via cross-node VPK sharding and DHT-backed resolution. | VPK process, roles (bob/eve/both), encrypted vector search, and DHT advertisement shipped. |
| Network | Intent-casting as a Layer 8 business protocol with economic settlement and neutrality guarantees. | libp2p + Kademlia DHT, trust-gated routing by model/trust/latency shipped. |

See **[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)** for the full living roadmap with contribution ideas for each area.
