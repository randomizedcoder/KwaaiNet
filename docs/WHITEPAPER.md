# KwaaiNet: A Trust-Centered Decentralized AI Network

**Technical Whitepaper — Version 0.3**
**Kwaai Foundation — March 2026**

---

## Abstract

KwaaiNet is an open-source, decentralized AI network that turns heterogeneous commodity hardware into a shared AI computer governed by verifiable trust rather than corporate policy. Its architecture places cryptographic identity and attestation at the center of three intersecting capabilities: distributed transformer inference, encrypted knowledge retrieval, and encrypted peer-to-peer networking. This paper describes the design, the protocol decisions, the current implementation status, and the research directions that remain open.

---

## 1. Introduction

The rapid deployment of large language models has consolidated AI infrastructure around a small number of hyperscale cloud providers. This concentration creates risks that are structural, not incidental: users and institutions that depend on centralized inference have no verifiable guarantee about data handling, no recourse against jurisdictional interference, and no resilience against provider failure. Even when model weights are published under open licenses, the infrastructure that serves them remains opaque and centralized.

Prior work on decentralized AI infrastructure has addressed individual aspects of this problem. Petals [1] demonstrated that large transformer models can be run collaboratively across volunteer hardware by pipelining activations through a chain of servers, each holding a contiguous range of transformer blocks. Federated learning [2] distributes training while keeping data local but does not address inference or knowledge retrieval. Secure multi-party computation [3] and homomorphic encryption [4] provide cryptographic privacy for computation and data, but have generally been studied in isolation from the networking and identity challenges of a production peer-to-peer system.

KwaaiNet combines these strands into a unified architecture grounded in one design bet: that **trust, identity, and attestation must be first-class primitives**, not retrofitted policies. The system is implemented in Rust, exposes an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API so that existing tooling requires no modification, and maintains wire-format compatibility with the Python Hivemind DHT network [5] so that nodes are immediately visible on existing network maps.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

Each KwaaiNet node is a single Rust process (`kwaainet`) composed of three subsystems and a mandatory trust core:

```rust
pub struct DistributedAINode {
    // Branch: Shared Compute
    inference_engine: CandelEngine,

    // Branch: P2P Network
    p2p_network: P2PNetwork,

    // Branch: Shared Secure Storage
    kb_engine: Option<KnowledgeBaseEngine>,

    // Center: Decentralized Trust
    identity: Option<IdentityProvider>,
    encryption_layer: E2EEncryption,
    trust_graph_client: Option<TrustGraphClient>,

    carbon_tracker: EnvironmentalMetrics,
    contribution_tracker: ResourceMetrics,
}
```

The three subsystems may be enabled independently: a node without a GPU can contribute storage and routing without serving inference. However, all participation — inference scheduling, storage placement, and connection gating — flows through the trust core. This paper treats each subsystem in turn, beginning with the trust core that underlies all of them.

---

## 3. Decentralized Trust

### 3.1 Persistent Cryptographic Identity

Each node generates an Ed25519 keypair [6] on first launch and writes it as a protobuf-encoded binary to `~/.kwaainet/identity.key`. The Ed25519 scheme was chosen for its compact key and signature sizes (32-byte public keys, 64-byte signatures), fast verification, and resistance to side-channel attacks compared with ECDSA [7]. The same key file is passed to the embedded `go-libp2p-daemon` [8] via its `-id` flag, ensuring that the libp2p `PeerId` and the application-layer identity are derived from the same keypair.

Two identifiers are derived deterministically from this keypair:

- **`PeerId`** — the libp2p peer identifier used for Kademlia DHT routing [9], stream multiplexing, and protocol dispatch.
- **`did:peer:`** — a W3C Decentralized Identifier [10] anchored to the same public key, used as the subject and issuer of Verifiable Credentials.

The persistence of this keypair is not merely a convenience: without a stable identity, each restart would produce a new `PeerId`, orphaning any credentials issued to the previous DID. The credential-identity binding would be broken every time the node restarts, making trust accumulation impossible.

### 3.2 Verifiable Credentials

The trust system implements W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.1 [11]. A `VerifiableCredential` carries a JSON-LD structure with `@context`, `type`, `issuer`, `issuanceDate`, optional `expirationDate`, and a `credentialSubject` block containing the attestation claims. Proofs use Ed25519 signatures over a canonical JSON serialization of the credential, allowing offline verification against the issuer's DID.

KwaaiNet defines six credential types, each representing a distinct tier of behavioral attestation:

| Credential | Issuer | Semantic Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `FiduciaryPledgeVC` | GliaNet | Operator signed the GliaNet Fiduciary Pledge |
| `VerifiedNodeVC` | Kwaai Foundation | Node passed Foundation onboarding |
| `UptimeVC` | Bootstrap servers | Node maintained uptime ≥ threshold over N days |
| `ThroughputVC` | Peer-witnessed | Throughput within X% of advertised value |
| `SummitAttendeeVC` | Summit organizer | Attendance at a Kwaai Personal AI Summit |
| `PeerEndorsementVC` | Any peer | Peer-to-peer reliability endorsement |

Credentials are stored in a local wallet at `~/.kwaainet/credentials/` and can be imported, listed, and verified entirely offline. A `BindingVC` type additionally links a passkey `did:key:` identity to a node's `did:peer:` DID, enabling user-to-node attribution without requiring users to manage raw keypairs.

### 3.3 Local Trust Score

Trust scores are computed locally by the querying node — there is no central registry. The score is a function of a node's verifiable credentials: their types, their issuers, and how recently they were issued. Credentials decay in value over time, keeping the trust graph current without requiring frequent re-issuance, drawing on the intuition from PageRank-derived reputation systems that stale information should contribute less [12].

As an illustrative example, a time-decayed weighted sum over credential types might look like:

```
score = min(1.0, Σ weight(vc_type) × 0.5^(age_days / 365))
```

where each credential type carries a weight reflecting its attestation strength — a peer-witnessed throughput benchmark contributing less than a signed fiduciary pledge, for instance — and the exponential term gives roughly a one-year half-life. Scores map to human-readable tiers (Unknown, Known, Verified, Trusted) that gate access to sensitive workloads.

The exact weighting scheme, decay function, and tier boundaries are under active development and will be finalized as the credential ecosystem matures.

### 3.4 Planned: EigenTrust Propagation

The current score is credential-only. Phase 4 will add transitive peer endorsements via a variant of the EigenTrust algorithm [13], which was originally developed to suppress malicious peers in Gnutella-scale P2P file-sharing networks. EigenTrust's key property is Sybil resistance: endorsements from low-trust nodes propagate proportionally less, so an attacker who creates many colluding identities cannot manufacture high trust scores for arbitrary peers. The planned formula:

```
Phase 4 score =
  w₁ × DirectPeerRatings
  w₂ × CredentialScore
  w₃ × TransitiveEndorsements  (weight × 0.5 per hop)
  × TimeDecay(age_of_assertions)
```

Until Phase 4 ships, the `peer_endorsement_contribution` field in the score struct is always `0.0`, and the system falls back entirely to the credential-weighted baseline.

## 4. Shared Compute

### 4.1 Block-Sharded Distributed Inference

KwaaiNet implements Petals-style pipeline parallelism [1] at the transformer block level. A model's layers are divided into contiguous ranges; each range is served by a different node. A coordinator discovers the block chain from the DHT, opens a session with each server in sequence, and pipes activation tensors from one to the next until the final node produces logits.

**Model format.** Distributed inference operates on models stored in the SafeTensors format [14], which provides memory-mapped, zero-copy tensor loading and does not execute arbitrary code on deserialization — a meaningful security property in a network of heterogeneous operators. GGUF models [15] are supported for single-node inference only; their quantization schemes are not currently compatible with the hidden-state wire format.

**Attention and positional encoding.** The shard implementation handles the standard Llama-family architecture [16]: Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) [17], in which position information is injected by rotating query and key vectors in pairs of dimensions with position-dependent angles; Grouped Query Attention (GQA) [18], which reduces KV-cache memory by sharing a smaller number of key-value heads across multiple query heads; and SwiGLU activation in the feed-forward sublayers [19]. Correct broadcast semantics are required for both RoPE (query has 32 heads; the cosine/sine tables have 1) and causal attention masking (score tensor shape `[1, 32, s, s]` vs. mask shape `[1, 1, s, s]`) — the implementation uses explicit broadcast operations throughout rather than relying on operator overloading, following the `candle` framework's conventions [20].

**Inter-node transport protocol.** The activation transport uses a custom libp2p protocol:

```
/kwaai/inference/1.0.0
```

Messages are serialized using MessagePack [21], chosen for its compact binary representation and broad multi-language support. Tensor data is packed as raw little-endian bytes: token IDs as `u32-LE`, hidden states and logits as `f16-LE` (IEEE 754 half-precision [22]). Each exchange carries a `session_id: u64` that links to a per-session KV cache on the serving node; sessions expire after 600 seconds of inactivity and are garbage-collected by a background task.

The message flow is:

```
Coordinator                          Block Server
  │── InferenceRequest (msgpack) ──────────────▶│
  │   {session_id, seq_pos,                      │
  │    payload_type, shape, data}                │
  │                                              │  runs local blocks
  │◀── InferenceResponse (msgpack) ─────────────│
  │   {session_id, response_type,                │
  │    shape, data}                              │
```

The first node in the chain receives `payload_type: TokenIds`; every subsequent node receives `payload_type: HiddenStates`. The last node responds with `response_type: Logits`.

**DHT advertisement.** When a node starts serving blocks, it publishes a DHT record using the Hivemind wire format [5], which KwaaiNet extends with additional fields while maintaining backward compatibility (unknown map keys are silently ignored by legacy clients):

```
Key:   SHA1(msgpack("{model_prefix}.{block_index}"))
Value: Ext(64, msgpack([state_i32, throughput_f64,
         {start_block, end_block, peer_id, public_name, …}]))
```

The `peer_id` field in the map payload is a KwaaiNet extension that allows chain discovery to recover node addresses directly from DHT responses without a separate lookup round-trip.

**Warm-up state.** A node registers on the DHT and marks itself visible (`state = 0`) before weights have finished loading. The inference handler is backed by an `Arc<RwLock<Option<TransformerShard>>>` lazy cell — requests that arrive during warm-up block on the read lock until the shard is populated, so the global chain view remains consistent and coordinators do not need to handle a separate "node loading" error case.

**Dynamic rebalancing.** A background rebalancer periodically queries the DHT, identifies coverage gaps — block ranges with fewer than the target number of serving nodes — and restarts the local shard at a gap range. To prevent thundering-herd reconvergence when many nodes simultaneously detect the same gap, each node adds a jitter delay of 0–60 seconds derived deterministically from the last byte of its `PeerId`. This avoids synchronized re-announcements while remaining reproducible across restarts [23].

### 4.2 Sampling and Decoding

The final logit vector is sampled locally by the coordinator. The implementation supports temperature scaling, top-k filtering, and nucleus (top-p) sampling [24]. Temperature $T$ rescales logits before the softmax: low temperatures concentrate probability mass on the highest-scoring tokens (approaching greedy decoding at $T \to 0$); high temperatures flatten the distribution, increasing diversity. Top-k restricts sampling to the $k$ highest-probability tokens; top-p dynamically selects the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds threshold $p$, adapting the effective vocabulary to the model's confidence at each step.

### 4.3 OpenAI-Compatible API

`kwaainet shard api` exposes an HTTP server with a drop-in OpenAI-compatible interface:

```
GET  /v1/models
POST /v1/chat/completions    (streaming SSE + non-streaming)
POST /v1/completions         (streaming SSE + non-streaming)
```

The server discovers the shard chain once at startup and serializes concurrent requests through a single `Arc<Mutex<P2PClient>>` to avoid session-ID collisions on the DHT. Existing clients — editors, agents, evaluation harnesses — require no modification to use a KwaaiNet-backed inference endpoint.

### 4.4 Secret Custom Embeddings

For RAG workloads requiring stronger privacy guarantees than standard embedding storage provides, KwaaiNet supports tenant-specific embedding projection. A base embedding model produces a standard dense vector; the tenant applies a private linear projection that maps it into a tenant-specific latent space before storage or transmission.

Recent work has demonstrated that plain text can often be reconstructed with high fidelity from standard embeddings alone [25], making raw embedding storage a meaningful privacy risk for sensitive corpora. A private projection matrix raises the bar for inversion: an adversary who obtains stored vectors from a compromised storage node cannot reconstruct useful approximations without also possessing the projection, substantially complicating reconstruction attacks. The projection itself is never stored on network nodes; only the tenant holds it.

---

## 5. Shared Secure Storage

### 5.1 Virtual Private Knowledge (VPK)

The Shared Secure Storage layer is implemented as a separate process, **VPK** (Virtual Private Knowledge), which KwaaiNet discovers and advertises via the DHT — analogous to how KwaaiNet relates to a locally running Ollama instance today. KwaaiNet does not own or spawn VPK; the two processes share a single binding value: the node's `PeerId` base58 string, set once in the VPK configuration and obtained from `kwaainet identity show`.

The integration has two channels:

1. **PeerId binding.** VPK is configured with the KwaaiNet node's `PeerId`, binding its tenant data to the node's cryptographic identity in the trust graph.

2. **DHT advertisement.** Before each DHT announcement cycle, the KwaaiNet node polls the local VPK health endpoint (`GET http://localhost:{port}/api/health`) and includes the returned capability metadata in two DHT records:
   - The per-block `Ext(64)` record gains a `"vpk"` field.
   - A separate `_kwaai.vpk.nodes` registry stores a per-peer dictionary of VPK capability maps, each entry containing `mode`, `endpoint`, `capacity_gb`, `tenant_count`, and `vpk_version`.

Any node on the network can run `kwaainet vpk discover` to locate VPK-capable peers without running VPK itself.

### 5.2 Multi-Tenant Isolation

VPK nodes serve three roles:

| Mode | Role |
|---|---|
| `bob` | Data owner — encrypts and submits documents |
| `eve` | Storage provider — holds encrypted shards |
| `both` | Serves both roles simultaneously |

Every document, embedding, and metadata entry carries a `tenant_id` bound to its originating DID. All query execution is scoped to that identifier. Multiple tenants may share a physical Eve node without access to each other's data; the `tenant_id` column propagates through all storage, index, and audit tables.

A DHT-backed shard manager maintains the mapping from tenant knowledge bases to Eve nodes, handles replication, and rebalances on churn — applying the same gap-filling logic described for inference block sharding.

### 5.3 Homomorphic Encryption for Confidential Vector Search

The knowledge plane is designed around a pipeline that preserves confidentiality through the full retrieval path, drawing on the body of work on homomorphic encryption [4, 26] and encrypted similarity search [27].

**Preparation (data owner / Bob).**
1. Compute dense embeddings for each document.
2. Apply the tenant-specific secret custom embedding projection (§4.4), followed by dimensional scrambling and carefully tuned noise injection.
3. Encrypt the resulting vectors with a homomorphic scheme that supports approximate inner-product similarity without decryption.

**Encrypted storage (storage nodes / Eve).**
Eve nodes store only encrypted, scrambled, noise-injected embeddings and minimal encrypted metadata, partitioned into tenant-scoped shards. Eve nodes never hold plaintexts, embedding parameters, or decryption keys.

**Encrypted search (querying party / Alice).**
Alice's query is embedded and transformed under the same tenant secrets, then evaluated homomorphically against the stored encrypted vectors. Eve nodes compute approximate encrypted similarity scores — they observe neither the query embedding nor the document embeddings in plaintext.

**Result handling.**
Eve returns encrypted scores and document indices. Only key-holding parties — Bob, an authorized delegate, or a confidential-computing enclave — decrypt scores, select top-*k* results, and route approved context to the language model. The LLM itself receives only plaintext excerpts that Bob's key-holder chose to disclose.

This pipeline is similar in spirit to cuVS-backed encrypted retrieval [28], but operates in a decentralized multi-tenant setting without a trusted coordinator.

### 5.4 Inversion and Wire-Tap Resistance

Two independent properties compound to resist passive adversaries:

- **Inversion resistance.** The combination of secret projection, dimensional scrambling, and noise injection makes high-quality embedding inversion substantially harder than against standard publicly-produced embeddings. The secret projection alone does not constitute information-theoretic security, but it eliminates the black-box inversion attack demonstrated in [25] by requiring the adversary to also recover the projection matrix.

- **Wire-tap resistance via index-based retrieval.** Similarity search returns compact document indices, not content. A network adversary observing query traffic captures encrypted scores and integer indices — not document text — then must separately compromise the content channel to reconstruct the retrieved passages. This reduces leakage from traffic-pattern analysis compared with approaches that stream full document content in response to similarity queries.

Trust scoring governs which Eve nodes are eligible to hold a given tenant's shards, ensuring that Shared Secure Storage always intersects the central trust layer for placement and access decisions.

---

## 6. P2P Network

### 6.1 Transport Stack

All inter-node communication uses **libp2p** [8] as the networking substrate, managed through an embedded `go-libp2p-daemon` (`p2pd`) that the CLI starts and supervises alongside the main process. libp2p provides transport-layer encryption via Noise [29] and TLS 1.3, stream multiplexing via Yamux, NAT traversal via circuit relay, and a protocol negotiation layer (multistream-select) that maps human-readable protocol strings to typed handlers.

Two application-layer protocols are currently registered:

- `DHTProtocol.rpc_find` — Hivemind DHT lookups; wire-format compatible with Python Hivemind bootstrap nodes.
- `/kwaai/inference/1.0.0` — block-shard activation transfers (§4.1).

### 6.2 Distributed Hash Table

KwaaiNet's DHT uses the Kademlia algorithm [9] as implemented by the Hivemind protocol [5]. Kademlia organizes nodes in a binary tree keyed by XOR distance, providing O(log N) lookup time for N participating nodes and tolerating concurrent failures without a central coordinator. Keys are 20-byte DHTID values derived by SHA-1 hashing msgpack-encoded key strings — the same derivation used by Python Hivemind — ensuring interoperability:

```
DHTID(key) = SHA1(msgpack(key))
```

KwaaiNet nodes appear on external network visualization tools (e.g., `map.kwaai.ai`) without additional bridging, because they participate in the same DHT namespace as the broader Hivemind network.

Bootstrap peers are drawn from a configurable `initial_peers` list in `~/.kwaainet/config.yaml`; if empty, the network defaults to known Petals bootstrap addresses. DHT records carry a 360-second TTL and are re-announced on a background loop.

### 6.3 Intent Routing

Clients express intent rather than binding to fixed servers: "run model X over these token IDs", "RAG over tenant Y with minimum trust tier Z". The network resolves each intent into concrete nodes:

1. Query the DHT for all block records matching the target model prefix.
2. Decode each `Ext(64)` record to extract peer IDs, block ranges, and announced throughput.
3. Filter candidates by trust tier if the intent specifies a minimum tier.
4. Construct the inference chain using a widest-coverage-first ordering; skip nodes that fail RPC calls with a logged warning rather than aborting the request.

Step 3 is the point at which trust gating operates: a low-trust node may be unreachable at the networking layer not because it is down, but because upstream nodes refuse streams from peers below their configured minimum tier. This makes trust enforcement decentralized — no single gateway enforces it — while remaining locally consistent for each participating node.

---

## 7. Security Properties and Limitations

### 7.1 Properties Provided

- **Stable cryptographic identity** with a verifiable attestation chain anchored in W3C standard credentials.
- **Encrypted transport** for all inter-node traffic via Noise and TLS 1.3.
- **Partial inference privacy.** Intermediate shard nodes receive only hidden-state activation tensors — not the original prompt tokens — and return hidden states rather than generated text. An adversary operating a single middle shard observes neither the input nor the output of an inference request in plaintext.
- **Tenant-isolated encrypted storage** with homomorphic similarity search (Eve nodes never hold plaintext).
- **Local trust computation** — no central authority can grant or revoke trust; each node computes its own view.

### 7.2 Known Limitations

**Collusion attack on inference.** An adversary who controls both the first shard node (which sees input token IDs) and the last shard node (which produces output logits) can reconstruct the prompt-to-completion pair. Trust tiers mitigate this risk by restricting which nodes may serve boundary positions for sensitive workloads, but do not eliminate it. The long-term mitigation is confidential-computing enclaves (e.g., Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP) for inference shards, which the architecture is designed to accommodate.

**Unsigned DHT records.** DHT entries in the current Hivemind wire format are not cryptographically signed by their authors. A node with DHT write access can publish false capability records — advertising blocks it does not serve, or VPK capacity it does not have. Trust scoring provides partial defense (low-trust nodes are deprioritized), but the underlying DHT protocol does not enforce record authenticity.

**Phase 4 peer endorsements not yet implemented.** Current trust scores are credential-only; the EigenTrust propagation layer that provides Sybil resistance for peer endorsement graphs is planned for Phase 4.

**Cross-node VPK shard placement.** Eve node discovery is operational (`kwaainet vpk discover`), but cross-node shard splitting — placing a tenant's encrypted knowledge base across multiple Eve nodes with redundancy — is targeted for Phase 2 of the VPK roadmap.

**Node version opacity.** Nodes running older builds silently fail RPC calls when the serving protocol is not registered. The `kwaainet_version` field in the DHT wire format is tracked as a near-term addition to make version skew visible in `kwaainet shard chain` output.

## 9. Conclusion

KwaaiNet is not a research prototype of decentralized AI — it is a working system running on commodity hardware today. Its defining architectural commitment is to treat trust as infrastructure rather than policy: every node has a verifiable identity, every claim about uptime or throughput is a signed credential, and every scheduling and placement decision is computed locally from first principles rather than delegated to a central authority.

The encrypted storage and inference pipelines are deliberately incremental. The current system already separates activation tensors from plaintext prompts at intermediate shard nodes, and stores knowledge bases encrypted at rest with strict tenant isolation. The path to full end-to-end confidentiality — homomorphic encrypted vector search, confidential-computing inference enclaves, and EigenTrust-grounded Sybil resistance — is well-defined and laid on a foundation that is already running at scale.

KwaaiNet is open-source, developed by a nonprofit AI lab, and designed to run on hardware already owned by individuals, communities, and institutions. It is intended to remain that way.
